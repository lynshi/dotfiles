A collection of tools that I've found useful. If I'm setting up a new project, these are the tools I'm bringing today.

# Python
* [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/): Linter and formatter.
* [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): Package manager and tool executor (`uvx <tool>`, or `uv tool install <tool>`).

# Code hygiene
* [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Easily declare and run pre-commit hooks.
